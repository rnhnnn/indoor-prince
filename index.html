                <p>Unexpectedly getting a castle, fortress, or any kind of large estate to live in a game sends me immediately over the moon—as quickly as rainy scenes do. I mostly blame <em>Suikoden</em> for that, but also, every time one of these rare castle-owning moment happens I'm also remember a moment when I was very young: I had just finished Jade Empire for the first time, totally obssesed with it, and surfing the web I found out in some official Xbox site about a fortress.</p>

                <p>There's one thing in <em>Dragon Age II</em> (damn, how I wish I could call it <em>Dragon Age: Exodus</em>) I'd like to see again in a new fantasy RPG, and it's that idea of the whole story taking place in just one city: to have all companions residing and living their lives in its different districts, and to see the culture change over years of side-questing for its citizens—as a foreigner. <s>And with a narrative framed by Varric.</s></p>

                <p>There were some headlines about digital stores <em>maybe</em> having to stop using the word “Buy” in the future, and thinking about it sent me down a very familiar rabbit hole of our times. I guess in the end everything is just tears in the rain, really... But a future with more backup and access options would be a better one.</p>

                <p>As an update to <a href="#community-sliders">what I wrote last year about <em>FC 24</em></a>, I have to say that I ended up enjoying that game a lot. Mostly because it was a beautiful dream season in real life (from Jude’s preseason goal till <a href="#life-is-magical-and-full-of-joy">the very end at Wembley</a>), but also thanks to Operation Sports’ sliders. It was a  great last dance for <a href="#toni-kroos">Kroos</a> and <a href="#el-bernabeu">the old Bernabéu</a>.</p>

                <p>And now it's time for <em>FC 25</em>; with Bellingham on the cover, a playable Zidane for weird Player Career Modes and... I don’t know—it's fun. I'll keep trying to extend Modric's contract for as long as I can, and that would be enough.</p>

                <p>It’s funny, but in my head there’s this very nostalgic association between <em>FIFA 2005</em> and <em>RPG Maker XP</em> that’s kind of being mirrored today with <em>FC 25</em> and <em>RPG Maker MZ</em>. And if I could speak to that young self of mine, suffering the <em>post-Makélélé</em> era in front of a CRT, I would definitely tease Lisboa 2014...</p>

                <p>And <em>Disco Elysium</em>.</p>

                <p>Long before the <em>Underground</em>, the <em>Depths</em>, and the <em>Underdark</em>... I first had to stumble around in the <em>Deep Roads</em>. Revisiting <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> has brought back everything: the multiple days of struggle in caves and tunnels, the non-stop combat encounters, and how my 2009 computer was barely holding together during the whole dwarven plot.</p>

                <p>But it also reminded me of the lore, and why Orzammar stayed on my mind for so long—this time, with Shale!</p>

                <p>Out of what felt like a thousand magical highlights... maybe my strongest dork reaction came with the unexpected McDohl-bot, appearing totally out of the blue, as in a first playthrough of <em>Suikoden II</em>.

                <p>Oddly, the five Blackwell games have been in my head a lot for the past few <s>years</s> days, as I think over the idea of a game I would like to make. I’ve been thinking of maybe replaying them all for a third time, not only because time with Rosa and Joey is always an awesome idea, but because this time I’ll be particularly interested in all the developer-commentary stuff.</p>

                <p>In <em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising</em>... something about those balloon reactions popping above the characters’ heads unlocked mamny memories for me. Memories of being fourteen years old, tinkering with <em>RPG Maker 2003</em>, and of being wide-eyed and dreaming big with the release of <em>RPG Maker XP</em>. I remembered making ugly sprites in a program called <em>GraphicsGale</em>, and falling in love with <em>Suikoden II</em>’s spritesheets way before playing the game itself.</p>

                <p>I think I’ll give <em>RPG Maker MZ</em> a closer look.</p>

                <p>Games spent enough time in my head for the creation of this blog to feel almost inevitable. Or maybe it has to do with the year ending?</p>

                <p>In any case, here it is! I’m not entirely sure about what the goal of these scribbles is, but for now, I hope that someday it will be fun to look back at these thoughts and remember... just how breathtaking my first playthrough of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> was.</p>
